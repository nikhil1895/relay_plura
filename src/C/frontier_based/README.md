Frontier based Exploration
---

If the robots know their relative locations and share a map of the area they explored so far, then effective coordination can be achieved by guiding the robots into different, non-overlapping areas of the environment. This can be done by assigning the robots to different exploration frontiers, which are transitions from explored free-space to unexplored areas.
